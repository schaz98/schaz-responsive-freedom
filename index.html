                Hengaw Organization for Human Rights was founded in October 2016 by a group of human rights activists to report about the extensive human rights violations that were occurring in the Kurdish areas in west of Iran. Hengaw relies on a network of anonymous human rights volunteers and Kurdish citizens in the west of the country to report about the human rights violations. Hengaw has no affiliation with any political party. Their reporting on the treatment of Kolbars has been used by the United Nations. Since 2022, their reporting on the crackdown of protesters in Iranian Kurdistan during the Mahsa Amini protests in 2022 has been used by various international media outlets.
